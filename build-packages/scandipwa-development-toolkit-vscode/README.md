# ScandiPWA development toolkit

### Overview

Made to *simplify* your work with ScandiPWA.

This extension is for development ScandiPWA and projects based on it in VSCode editor.

Basically, it is an API to the same functionality that `scandipwa-cli` offers. If something is able to be achieved by using these tools - we recommend using them. It has been proven to produce safer code than manual copying/templating/etc.

The functionality of this extension is identical to `scandipwa-cli`.

You will be asked to choose the ScandiPWA module (theme or extension), where to create/override resources. So yes, this tool is able to help you even with extensions and external modules!

### Commands

- ScandiPWA: Create. Creates templates for new resources from scratch.
- ScandiPWA: Extend. Use this to properly and safe override the existing functionality.

### Configuration
